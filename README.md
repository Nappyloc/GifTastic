#### Coding Bootcamp Unit 6 Homework


##### Description
  This is a project designed to bring a little laughter to your day while showcasing my ability to to use the GIPHY API, JavaScript, and JQuery to manipulate HTML.
  
  I chose to focus on old school action hero's due to the selection of Gifs that were returned. The front end design could definitly use some more work to improve the overall look of the site. My biggest challenge with this project was organizing the Gifs returned to the page.
